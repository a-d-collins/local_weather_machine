 Weather_Machine_v.1.1
 
1.1:
-- Ignore goals of Version 1.0
-- Read into asynchrony, javascript promises, generators, and promise-aware-generators that help avoid messy and callback-riddled JS code.
-- More familiar with how to implement that (better-looking) code. It's fancy stuff. Super fancy, but there's no need to bother with it right now.
-- Implement a callback-based version (i.e. ignoring the improvements provided by promise-aware-generators).

 
1.0:
-- Goals:
    1. UTILIZE WEATHER UNDERGROUND API
    2. FIND CLOSEST WEATHER STATION TO GIVEN GPS COORDINATES
    3. GATHER LOCAL WEATHER FROM THAT STATION
